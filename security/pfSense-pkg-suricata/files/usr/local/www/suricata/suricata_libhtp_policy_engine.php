	This file contains code for adding/editing an existing Libhtp Policy Engine.
	It is included and injected inline as needed into the suricata_app_parsers.php
	page to provide the edit functionality for Host OS Policy Engines.

	The following variables are assumed to exist and must be initialized
	as necessary in order to utilize this page.

	$g --> system global variables array
	$config --> global variable pointing to configuration information
	$pengcfg --> array containing current Libhtp Policy engine configuration

	Information is returned from this page via the following form fields:

	policy_name --> Unique Name for the Libhtp Policy Engine
	policy_bind_to --> Alias name representing "bind_to" IP address for engine
	personality --> Operating system chosen for engine policy
	select_alias --> Submit button for select alias operation
	req_body_limit --> Request Body Limit size
	resp_body_limit --> Response Body Limit size
	enable_double_decode_path --> double-decode path part of URI
	enable_double_decode_query --> double-decode query string part of URI
	enable_uri_include_all --> inspect all of URI
	save_libhtp_policy --> Submit button for save operation and exit
	cancel_libhtp_policy --> Submit button to cancel operation and exit
